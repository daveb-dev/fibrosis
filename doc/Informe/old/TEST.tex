Googling didnt give required results.(many, but not applicable or code doesn't work)

Essentially, what I want to do is the same formatting I just did with this question.

I am really sceptical about LaTeX whenever you encounter problem which can't be solved in 30 minutes means that you are unlikely to find correct solution.

What I use at the moment is \verb|'\\\\'|. Being from developers' circle I tend to deal with all kind of warning. These four slashes give me 'badboxes'. How to produce exactly same correct formatting I just did now with this text.

I appreciate your help and not critics. These kind of operations should not be a ritual dance around the fire in the first place.
